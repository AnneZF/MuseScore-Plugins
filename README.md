# MuseScore-Plugins

## check-intervals.qml
Checks intervals of score according to Palestrina's style of modal counterpoint.
To use: select notes to analyse and click 'Apply'. Will apply from start of bar to all staves.

Known bugs: 
- selecting last bar causes selection to fail 
- does not check for 6/5 chords


Plans to update to allow user to select intervals that are permitted.
