# MuseScore-Plugins

## check-intervals.qml
Checks intervals of score according to Palestrina's style of modal counterpoint.
To use: select notes to analyse and click 'Apply'.

Known bugs: selecting last bar causes selection to fail, doesn not check for 6/5 chords

Plans to update to allow user to select intervals that are permitted.
