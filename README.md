## check-intervals.qml
Checks intervals of score according to Palestrina's style of modal counterpoint.
Select notes and run. Will apply from start of bar to all staves.

Known bugs: 
- selecting last bar causes selection to fail

Plans to update to allow user to select intervals that are permitted.
